## Labels

Labels are used to give you a better understanding of how a mod may act.
| Name | Meaning |
| :--: | :-----: |
| Alpha | Mod is in alpha and therefore might be unstable. |
| Bloat | Contain content that might not be desirable and cant be turned off via configs, commands, or other methods. |
| Buggy | Mod is buggy. |
| Configuration Needed | Mod needs to be configured to act at its best. |
| Corruption | Mod has a chance to corrupt save files. |
| Incompatible | Mod is incompatible with some mods. |
| Reverse Features | Mod takes away features for sake of performance or bugfixes. |
| Unstable | Mod is unstable and may act unpredictably. |
| Replaced | Mod is completely replaced by another, newer, alternative. |

## Severity Level

Severity Level is used alongside labels for a clearer understanding of how severe the issue is.
| Level | Meaning |
| :---: | :-----: |
| 1 | Low chance to affect user |
| 2 | Low to medium chance to affect user |
| 3 | Medium chance to affect user |
| 4 | Medium to high chance to affect user |

## Extra Information

You might find some superscripted numbers around the repository. These are used to tell extra information about the mods that labels and severity levels do not apply to.

¹ The mod should work if [Mixin-0-7-0-8-Compatibility](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mixin-0-7-0-8-compatibility) is applied
___
² Cull Particles isn't needed anymore in newer Forge versions, as it was implemented in Forge
___
³ Do not blame me if you didn't read this notice. *If you try to load a older world in a newer instance of the game, and you have one of these mods installed, bad things will happen*, make sure to uninstall the mod first
___
⁴ Some of the mods that have Sodium as an incompatibility, might work if you use [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium)
___
⁵ AI Improvements newer versions (1.14+) don't have as much impact as the older versions have, since in newer versions of Minecraft, a lot of fixes to the AI are implemented ([Sources: Curseforge page FAQ, [Dev](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/254806806516203520/831525756143534150/unknown.png)])
___
⁶ Halogen has issues with Forge's ExplosionEvent, see [sodium-forge#33](https://github.com/spoorn/sodium-forge/issues/33)
___
⁷ These mods also work on 1.17.x , despite having only 1.16 and 1.18 releases in curseforge, no workarounds needed. Install them like any other mods and your fabric loader won't complain about missing dependencies
___
⁸ Some of the mods that have Magnesium/Rubidium as an incompatibility, might work if you use [Calcium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/calcium)
