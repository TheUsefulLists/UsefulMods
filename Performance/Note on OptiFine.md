# About OptiFine

You may have noticed that OptiFine isn't on any of these lists. We are aware of this and have not included OptiFine because of its' various compatibility issues. Its' code is closed-source, so it's very hard to troubleshoot any crashes or bugs. Also, it is not natively available on Fabric, which causes many more problems when trying to use a workaround to make it work on Fabric.<br>
Furthermore, OptiFine provides very little performance gain in a modded Minecraft instance, making its use not very compelling.<br><br>

If you still want to use OptiFine for custom resource packs or any other reason, you can try it, but we can't guarantee that it will work with all the mods mentioned in our lists. In most cases, alternatives like Sodium, Continuity, LBG etc. will work much better.
